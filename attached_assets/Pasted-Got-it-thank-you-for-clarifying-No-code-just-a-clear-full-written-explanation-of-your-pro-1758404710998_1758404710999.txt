# Lemur — Gas Station AI Management & Task Dashboard

## Overview

**Lemur** is an all-in-one AI-powered management dashboard designed to streamline gas station operations. It acts as a **central hub** where employees and managers can log in, receive tasks, record work, and access key tools (lottery, cigarette inventory, cooler checks, etc.).

The system is built to **increase accountability, reduce downtime, and give managers control** while making the workflow simple for employees.

---

## Branding & Login

* The dashboard is branded with the name **“Lemur”** at the top.
* Employees log in using a simple **PIN system**.
* Once logged in, the homepage shows large, easy-to-understand **tiles (buttons)** for different work areas.

---

## Main Dashboard Sections

The **homepage** of Lemur contains several sections. Each section is represented as a **tile** that an employee can click to open a page.

### 1. **Lottery**

* Tile labeled **“Lottery”**.
* Clicking it opens a page with a **pre-filled external link** (such as Modisoft).
* Employees perform all lottery operations there.

### 2. **LRTRI Cigarette Inventory**

* Tile labeled **“Inventory”**.
* Clicking it opens either:

  * An **external link** to your LRTRI cigarette inventory system, OR
  * A built-in page where cigarette stock is tracked.

### 3. **Temperature Logs**

* Tile labeled **“Coolers/Freezers.”**
* Employees check and record temperatures every **3 hours**.
* **AI rules:**

  * If readings are in normal range → no change.
  * If readings start to rise → checks become more frequent.
  * If readings exceed safe limits → Lemur sends alerts to move items to backup storage.

### 4. **Tasks**

* Tile labeled **“Tasks.”**
* Employees see their assigned work here.
* **Features include:**

  * **Common recurring tasks** (like cleaning or stocking).
  * **Special tasks** (assigned by the manager).
  * If a task is skipped, it reappears at the next login.
  * Each task has **verification** — the next shift confirms whether it was done.
  * Proof options: employees can add a **note** or a **photo upload**.

### 5. **Custom Links (Manager Only)**

* The manager can add **new tiles directly on the homepage.**
* To add: just copy-paste a link (e.g., vendor site, HR docs, supply orders).
* The tile instantly appears, and employees can click it to open that page.

### 6. **Schedule**

* A schedule section shows **who is on shift**.
* Managers can upload a schedule (e.g., from Excel).
* The AI cross-checks shifts with tasks and verifications.

## Task System

Lemur keeps employees accountable by making tasks visible, tracked, and verified.

* **Assignment**

  * Employees get a **7-day rotation** of standard duties.
  * Managers can assign **special one-time tasks.**

* **Acknowledgement & Proof**

  * Employees mark tasks “done.”
  * Optional text note or photo proof can be attached.

* **Verification**

  * The **next shift worker** checks if the task was truly completed.
  * If verified → task is closed.
  * If failed → flagged, and the manager is alerted.

* **AI Reminders**

  * Missed tasks are carried forward to the next login.
  * Alerts keep everyone on track.

---

## Alerts & AI Assistant

The AI works like a **digital assistant manager**:

* **Temperature alerts** if coolers/freezers get too warm.
* **Task reminders** for missed work.
* **Escalations** when critical issues aren’t fixed.
* **Employee appreciation** tracking for recognition and motivation.

---

## Manager Tools

Managers get a private **Admin section** where they can:

* Add/edit employees.
* Add **custom dashboard tiles** (by pasting links).
* Upload shift schedules.
* Assign or edit tasks.
* View alerts and logs of employee actions.

---

## Long-Term Vision

The first version of Lemur starts simple: **dashboard, tasks, inventory, lottery, and temperature checks.**
Over time, it can expand to include:

* Messaging or notifications to employees.
* More advanced analytics.
* Optional integrations with cameras or vendor systems.

---

✅ **In summary:** Lemur is a branded gas station dashboard that:

* Keeps employees busy with assigned and verified tasks.
* Tracks cooler/freezer temperatures with AI alerts.
* Gives managers control through a customizable homepage.
* Provides accountability and recognition for employees.
