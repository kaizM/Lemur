Got it 👍 Thanks for sharing the actual links. I’ll now rewrite the **full, final project description** with the correct Modisoft and Cigarette Inventory URLs included. No coding — just a clear detailed explanation.

# Lemur — Gas Station AI Management & Task Dashboard

## Overview

**Lemur** is a branded AI-powered dashboard designed to simplify gas station management. It provides employees with a **focused workspace** where they can only access the tools they need, while managers have a private control panel for scheduling, oversight, and customization.

Employees log in with a **phone number/PIN**, see their assigned tasks, and can quickly access inventory and lottery systems. Managers use Lemur as a central hub for scheduling, task management, and monitoring store performance.

---

## Branding & Login

* The dashboard is branded with the name **“Lemur”** at the top.
* **Employees log in** using their phone number/PIN.
* After login, employees are shown only the tools relevant to their daily work.
* **Managers have private access** to scheduling, customization, and advanced features.

## Employee Dashboard (What Workers See)

When employees log in, they see **four main sections**:

1. **Lottery (Modisoft)**

   * Tile labeled **“Lottery.”**
   * Clicking opens the Modisoft lottery website:
     👉 [https://modisoft.com](https://modisoft.com)

2. **Cigarette Inventory**

   * Tile labeled **“Inventory.”**
   * Clicking opens the Cigarette Inventory system:
     👉 [https://luxury-cajeta-636124.netlify.app](https://luxury-cajeta-636124.netlify.app)

3. **Temperature Logs (Coolers & Freezers)**

   * Tile labeled **“Coolers/Freezers.”**
   * Employees record temperatures every **3 hours.**
   * **AI rules:**

     * Temps in normal range → standard 3-hour checks.
     * Temps rising → checks become more frequent.
     * Temps too hot → alerts are triggered to move stock to backup storage.

4. **Tasks**

   * Tile labeled **“Tasks.”**
   * Shows assigned duties for that shift.
   * **Task flow:**

     * Employees complete tasks and mark them as done (optionally adding a note or photo).
     * The **next shift verifies** whether the task was truly completed.
     * If a task is missed, Lemur automatically carries it forward until it’s finished.

## Manager Dashboard (What Only You See)

Managers have access to an **Admin section** not visible to employees:

1. **Schedule (Private to Manager)**

   * Upload and manage employee shift schedules.
   * **Employees do not see schedules** — this is manager-only.

2. **Custom Dashboard Links**

   * Add new homepage tiles for employees.
   * Example: “Vendor Orders,” “Training Portal,” or other business tools.
   * Just paste a link, and it becomes available instantly.

3. **Task Management**

   * Assign one-time or recurring tasks.
   * Monitor task completion and flagged items from verification.

4. **Employee Management**

   * Add/edit employee profiles.
   * Update phone numbers/PINs.
   * Set roles (employee or manager).

5. **Alerts & Reporting**

   * View alerts from cooler/freezer monitoring.
   * Track task failures or missed duties.
   * Access logs of employee activity.

## AI Assistant Role

The AI inside Lemur functions like a **digital supervisor**:

* Sends reminders for unfinished tasks.
* Escalates when cooler/freezer temps are unsafe.
* Carries incomplete tasks forward to the next shift.
* Tracks employee reliability and performance for recognition.

---

## Long-Term Vision

The **initial release** of Lemur focuses on:

* Modisoft Lottery (via direct link)
* Cigarette Inventory (via direct link)
* Temperature logging with alerts
* Task assignment and verification
* Private scheduling and manager customization

Future expansions could include:

* Automatic SMS/email reminders for tasks and alerts.
* Performance analytics and reporting dashboards.
* Vendor integrations for ordering and supply management.

---

✅ **In summary:**

* **Employees only see four tools:** Lottery, Cigarette Inventory, Temperature Logs, and Tasks.
* **Managers control everything else** — schedules, new links, task assignment, and reporting.
* Lemur keeps employees focused, accountable, and productive, while giving the manager total control.
