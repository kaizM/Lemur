Absolutely—here’s the **full, updated project spec** with the **AI features** and a **manager interface** to create **separate PINs for each employee** (so no one can access anyone else’s account). No code—just a clear blueprint you can hand to a developer or keep as your master plan.

# Lemur — Gas Station AI Management & Task Dashboard (Manager-First Spec)

## 1) Overview

**Lemur** is a branded, manager-led dashboard for your gas station. Employees log in with their **own unique PIN** and can only access:

* **Lottery (Modisoft)** → [https://modisoft.com](https://modisoft.com)
* **Cigarette Inventory (LRTRI)** → [https://luxury-cajeta-636124.netlify.app](https://luxury-cajeta-636124.netlify.app)
* **Temperature Logs (Coolers/Freezers)**
* **Tasks** (with cross-shift verification)

**Managers** use a private admin area to: create users & PINs, add custom tiles, assign tasks, manage temperature rules/alerts, and view reports. **Schedules are manager-only** (employees never see them).

---

## 2) Branding & Access

* Header branding: **“Lemur”**
* **Employee login**: Phone number + **unique PIN**
* **Manager login**: **Manager PIN = 786110** (full access)
* Session auto-logout after idle (manager sets time)

---

## 3) Manager: User & PIN Creation (the interface you asked for)

### A. “Users” Admin Screen (Manager-only)

An in-app page where you **create & manage each employee**. It includes:

**Create User form (fields you fill):**

* **Full name** (e.g., Alicia Khan)
* **Phone number** (used for identity & optional SMS later)
* **Unique PIN** (4–6 digits; **must be unique**; only they can use it)
* **Status** (Active / Suspended)
* **Start date** (optional)
* **Notes** (optional: store uniform size, preferred shift, etc.)

**Role handling:**

* You said you “don’t think so for roles”—so set **default** to *Employee* for everyone you create. Only you (with manager PIN 786110) have manager access.

**User protections & policies:**

* No two users may share a PIN.
* PINs are confidential; manager can **reset** any PIN.
* Employees can only see their own information and standard tiles (no schedule, no admin, no other people’s data).
* **Audit trail:** create/edit/reset logged with timestamp and manager ID.

**Bulk actions (optional, nice-to-have):**

* **CSV import** to create many users at once: `name,phone,pin,status`
* **Deactivate** (keep history but prevent login)

---

## 4) Employee Experience (what workers see after PIN login)

* **Lottery (Modisoft)** → opens [https://modisoft.com](https://modisoft.com)
* **Cigarette Inventory (LRTRI)** → opens [https://luxury-cajeta-636124.netlify.app](https://luxury-cajeta-636124.netlify.app)
* **Temperature Logs** → record readings every 3 hours; app shows next-due times
* **Tasks** → daily/weekly/common tasks and special tasks, with “Done” & cross-shift **Verify** steps; missed tasks carry forward

> Employees **do not** see: Schedule, Admin, Reports, or any other staff’s data.

---

## 5) AI Features (manager-controlled)

### A. AI Task Assistant

* **Natural-language assignment** (manager can type or dictate):
  “Assign Alicia to clean countertops before 10 AM daily and require a note.”
  AI converts to a task with frequency, due window, and proof rule.
* **Smart rotation (7-day)**
  AI balances common tasks across the week and across staff (no one is idle).
* **Carry-forward & reminders**
  If a task isn’t completed, AI resurfaces it on the same employee’s next login.
* **Cross-shift verification logic**
  AI prompts the next on-shift person to verify prior shift tasks; “No” flags the task for you.
* **Coaching nudges** (optional)
  Friendly prompts like: “Quick check: trash bins at pumps?”
* **Performance signals**
  Summaries of who completes on time, who often needs reminders (for your recognition program).

### B. AI Temperature Guardian

* **Bands (editable):**

  * ≤ **35°F** → Very Chill / OK
  * > 35–40°F → Normal
  * > 40–45°F → Watch
  * > 45°F → Alert
* **Escalations:**

  * Any reading **≥ 50°F** → **Next check due in 20 minutes** (instead of 3 hours) until temps stabilize (two consecutive readings < 45°F).
  * **Two consecutive readings ≥ 50°F** → **Critical Alert**: “Move stock to backup cooler/freezer now.”
* **AI messages** (examples):

  * “Freezer-1 at 51°F. Recheck in 20 minutes.”
  * “Freezer-1 still ≥ 50°F twice. Move product now & call service.”
* **Recovery tracking**: AI tracks trend until normal. Manager gets a “Resolved?” prompt.

### C. AI Schedule Understanding (manager-only)

* You can **upload a schedule** (Excel/CSV) or a **screenshot** (future enhancement).
* AI reads who is scheduled and uses this to:

  * route verification to the next shift
  * identify gaps (optional)
* **Important:** employees **never** see the schedule inside Lemur.

### D. Voice to Action (optional)

* Say: “Create special task for Jay: power-wash sidewalk this Friday at 2pm with photo proof.”
* AI converts this to a scheduled task with proof requirement.

## 6) Temperature Logs — operational details

* **Units setup (once):** e.g., Freezer-1, Cooler-Front, Ice-Cream-Box
* **Default cadence:** every **3 hours**
* **UI for employees:** list of units showing Last Reading, Status, and **Next Due**
* **Entering a reading:** choose unit → enter °F → optional note → save
* **What the AI does behind the scenes:**

  * Calculates status band
  * Adjusts next-due interval (normal vs 20-minute escalated)
  * Triggers alerts and places an **unresolved alert card** in the **Manager Alerts Center**
* **Compliance view (manager):** day grid showing on-time/late/missed entries

---

## 7) Tasks — operational details

* **Templates** you (manager) define once:

  * “Clean countertops” (daily, due by first hour, proof: note)
  * “Bathroom deep clean” (every Tue/Thu, proof: note + optional photo)
  * “Count cigarette packs” (weekly)
* **Assignment types:**

  * To a specific person
  * To “anyone on shift”
* **Employee flow:**

  * Sees task → does it → taps **Done** (optionally adds note/photo)
  * Next shift sees **Verify** → Yes/No (+ note)
* **Flags & alerts:**

  * “No” on verification → task **Flagged**; you see it in alerts/reports
* **Carry-forward:**

  * Missed tasks reappear automatically on next login

---

## 8) Manager Admin: what else you control

* **Custom Tiles**

  * Add homepage buttons by pasting any URL (e.g., vendor orders, training portal)
  * Choose visibility: employees or manager-only
* **Schedule (private)**

  * Upload/manage; used by AI for routing verification; hidden from employees
* **Alerts Center**

  * See open/critical/resolved alerts with history and notes
  * Mark resolved; add comments (e.g., “Service ticket #12345”)
* **Reports & Exports**

  * Tasks (on-time, late, missed, flagged)
  * Temperatures (readings, escalations, resolution times)
  * User activity (logins, acknowledgements, verifications)
  * Export CSV for audits
* **Security & Policies**

  * Set idle timeout (auto-logout)
  * Reset PINs
  * Suspend/reactivate users

---

## 9) Data you should prepare (to fill the manager forms)

* **Employee list**: Name, Phone, Unique PIN, Status
* **Temperature units**: The actual coolers/freezers you own
* **Task templates**: 10–15 common duties + any special ones
* **Escalation SOP**: Who to call, where to move product, service vendor phone
* **External links**: (already set) Modisoft & LRTRI + any others you want as tiles
* **Schedule file** (optional now; useful later)

---

## 10) Daily flow (how it works in the store)

1. **Employee logs in** with their **own PIN** → sees only **Lottery, Inventory, Temperature Logs, Tasks**
2. **Temperature check** every 3 hours → AI adjusts intervals & alerts if needed
3. **Tasks** performed → **Done**; next shift **verifies** → **Yes/No**
4. **Manager** reviews **Alerts Center** & **Reports**; posts messages if needed
5. **Missed/flagged** items carry into next day until completed/resolved

---

## 11) Policies you control (recommended defaults)

* **PIN length**: 4–6 digits; **unique per person**
* **Idle timeout**: 10–15 minutes on public store computers
* **Proof rules**: Bathrooms & food-adjacent tasks require at least a text note
* **Verification**: Required for all cleaning & stocking tasks
* **Temperature critical**: Two ≥50°F readings → immediate move to backup + vendor call
* **Privacy**: Only manager sees schedules and full reports

---

## 12) What’s “done” for this phase (acceptance criteria)

* **Unique PIN accounts** created for every employee (via your Users admin screen)
* Employees can only open the 4 tiles (no schedule/admin)
* Temperature Logs enforce the 3-hour cadence, escalate at ≥50°F, and trigger alerts correctly
* Tasks support Done + cross-shift Verify + carry-forward of missed items
* Manager can add custom tiles, view alerts, and export reports
* Manager PIN **786110** unlocks all admin features

---

If you’d like, I can also draft:

* A **one-page “How to Use Lemur (Employee)”** you can print and post by the register
* A **Manager Setup Checklist** (first-day and weekly)
  Just say the word and I’ll write those up cleanly.
